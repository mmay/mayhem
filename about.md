Hello there, internet traveler.

#### My name is Michael May.

By professional experience and education I'm an engineer and entrepreneur. I have fun doing it, 
and like to think I'm pretty decent at it. Mostly because I give a damn and work hard.

In my personal reality I enjoy taking part in what I consider this remarkably short life.
I try to work hard towards becoming wise enough and brave enough to leave behind 
thought-provoking ideas, innovations, and inventions for those who come after me 
so that human existance may continue to thrive and expand to the furthest corners of the universe.
